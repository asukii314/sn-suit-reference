      <h3>Information we collect</h3>
      <p>Shining Nikki Suit Reference does not store any personally identifiable information about its users, anywhere on the site, for any reason. Some anonymized information is collected, as outlined below.</p>

      <b>3rd Party Sign-in</b>
      <p>If you sign in to Shining Nikki Suit Reference via either Facebook or Discord, the only information stored by the site is an anonymized user ID associated with the 3rd party login method you choose. <u>We do not store your name, email address, or any other such personal information</u>.</p>
      <p>During the log-in process, you will be redirected to a website associated with the 3rd party login provider you choose. While on those sites, be advised that Shining Nikki Suit Reference's Privacy Policy does not apply to either Discord or Facebook themselves. For more detailed information on how they may use your data, or for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices, please consult their respective Privacy Policies directly.</p>
      <p>Once you are logged in, Shining Nikki Suit Reference uses cookies to help keep you logged in. These cookies are cleared when you log out. You may also choose to disable cookies through your browser settings, if you prefer.</p>
      <p>Sign-in is optional; you are free to use the site without linking a 3rd party account. However, if you want to use the site to build your own custom wishlist/closet, you will need to sign in via either Facebook or Discord, so that the site “knows” whose wishlist/closet to associate with you.</p>

      <b>Log Files</b>
      <p>Shining Nikki Suit Reference collects basic, anonymized log files about how the site is used. No personally identifiable information is included in these logs.</p>
      <p>
A basic log entry includes only the page url & the date/time it was accessed. For actions that require login – for example, modifying your wishlist, marking a suit as owned/awakened, or logging in/out directly – the type of action is also logged, along with your anonymized user ID.</p>
